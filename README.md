<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Run the following command to ensure node is installed on your device

```
npm -v
```

If the npm command is not recognized, please install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
<br />
<br />

Additionally, if you have an iOS or android device, download the [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) app for previewing. Otherwise, [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is expo's official web-based alternative.

### Installation

1. Create [your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and clone that repository to a directory on your local computer

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/casa-ios-ctc.git
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

3. Run the application
```
npx expo start --reset-cache
```
  You should now have a React Native / Typescript app running on
  the localhost address displayed within your terminal. A QR code should also appear.
  <br />
  <br />
  To preview the application, scan the QR code on your iphone or import your forked repo into [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) by clicking the 3 dots to the right of "Project"



  ## ‚ú® Contributing & Onboarding
  
  Now that the project is set up, you can contribute to it! :)
  To ensure everything is working as it should, create an initial "landing pull request" this should be a small change such as adding an emoji or a greeting to the main page.
  - Within your local repo, run ```git status``` to ensure you're on the ```main``` branch then switch to the ``` casa_ios_onboarding ``` branch. To do so, attempt ``` git checkout casa_ios_onboarding ``` and read instructions
  - Create a seperate branch within your local repo with ```git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME```
  - Make your addition(s). Ensure that the edited files are added with
  ```git add CHANGED_FILE```, run ```git status``` often
  - Then, after every few changes, commit with ```git commit -m " YOUR COMMIT DESCRIPTION "```
  - Finally, ensuring my repo is set as the upstream, ```git push origin casa_ios_onboarding ``` the changes to your fork and make a pull request to this repo that resolves one of the     "Landing/Onboarding Pull Request's"


  Congratsüéâ, if you were not before, you are now an open source developer üòé
